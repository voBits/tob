Gittex is a decentralized Ethereum Token Exchange backged on GitHub with the most ERC20 listings of any exchange, and including new tokens from airdrops/bounties/ICOs.


# What is Gittex?
Gittex currently acts as an updated (new features), open source and updated interface for EtherDelta's smart contract with an active and public development. Although Gittex started as a fork of the fork of EtherDelta (ForkDelta), considerable development time has been put towards.

The purpose of Gittex is to have a name without "fork" and mentioning to GitHub, be a successor to EtherDelta and be home to new coins that have potential and are recently launched (and need to be listed in exchanges). It is agaisnt scam since it is backed in GitHub (no domain spoofing like occured in EtherDelta).


# How does Gittex Work?
Gittex currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract (described in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6kdiyl/smart_contract_overview/)) which allows Gittex users to trade utilizing EtherDelta's volume. But soon we will use our own smart contract.


# Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community. You can contribute by improving the code, documentation, or by donating. 
Gittex currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract which allows Gittex users to trade utilizing EtherDelta's volume. However, this means that the trading fees still go to EtherDelta and Gittex development costs come entirely out of our pockets. If you are interested in the Gittex project and would like to contribute to its future, please consider donating to the following Ethereum address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xFb9cd4E61a5FCa59CD134c960c8eF028A1db4Bd2">0xFb9cd4E61a5FCa59CD134c960c8eF028A1db4Bd2</a>
 
As this is a project by the community, for the community, transactions to and from the donations address will be public and can be viewed on the blockchain. We will also keep a public ledger of how the donations are distributed. That way, donors can see exactly how their donations are helping!
